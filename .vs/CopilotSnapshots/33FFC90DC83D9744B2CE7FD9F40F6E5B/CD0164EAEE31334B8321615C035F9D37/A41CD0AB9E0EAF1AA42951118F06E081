# AuthDemo Solution

## Overview
AuthDemo is a comprehensive .NET 8 solution demonstrating modern authentication and authorization patterns using OpenIddict and ASP.NET Core Identity. The solution includes multiple projects showcasing secure communication between client applications and protected API services.

## Project Structure
The solution consists of the following projects:

### Client Applications
- **AuthDemo.Blazor** (.NET 8)
  - Modern Blazor web application
  - Uses JWT token authentication
  - Communicates with secure API endpoints

- **AuthDemo.Razor** (.NET 8)
  - Alternative Razor-based web application
  - Implements flight scheduling interface
  - Demonstrates token-based authentication

### API Services
- **AuthDemo.Identity** (.NET 8)
  - OpenIddict authentication server
  - ASP.NET Core Identity integration
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - User and role management

- **AuthDemo.SecureDemoApi** (.NET 8)
  - Protected API endpoints
  - Role-based access control
  - OpenIddict token validation

- **AuthDemo.MockApiService** (.NET 8)
  - Sample API implementation
  - Weather forecast demo endpoint
  - Secured with OpenIddict

### Shared Components
- **AuthDemo.Shared**
  - Common models and DTOs
  - Shared interfaces
  - Cross-cutting concerns

## Authentication & Authorization

### Identity Framework
- Built on ASP.NET Core Identity
- OpenIddict integration for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
- JWT token-based authentication

### Available Scopes
- `admin.api`: Full administrative access
- `manager.api`: Management level access
- `user.api`: Basic user access

### Authentication Flow
1. User authenticates via Identity service
2. JWT token issued with appropriate scopes
3. Token used for subsequent API calls
4. API endpoints validate token and scopes
